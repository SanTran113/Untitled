Untitled is a creative writing app designed to keep track of facts of characters, stories (which include a synopsis, notes, and chapters), a timeline stories, and relationship charts of each character. Although, this can no doubt also be a web app, say notion or word, many writers struggle with capturing ideas when away from their computers say their day-to-day. This app mitigates that challenge by allowing you to instantly jot down ideas where they belong, rather than typing them out on notes and transferring them to your preferred writing web app.
